# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

A: You can call me Beiming or S1aury, one is my nativity and one is my game id. My recommended pronouns are he, his, his. My favorite game genres are FPS, party, rougelike games. Have participated in internships and some small gamejam competitions before. I'm basically doing planning work since I'm not much good at art or coding. If I will make games in future, I would actually want to make competitive games a bit.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [1] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
A: I'm hoping to get a rudimentary understanding of programming for games and make some simple features myself.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
A： Worried that I might not be good at programming, resulting in an overall lackluster GPA. Since I'll be able to transfer into the GDIM program after this quater, it's something I'm working on, but I still worry that I'll fail the class.

## Prior Experience
The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

N/A

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
N/A
2. Game development (any engine)
N/A
3. Unity
N/A
### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.
 N/A

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
In my perspective, this is a particularly large file, containing first of all the entire timetable for the production of the game, the work that needs to be done at each time, including the art and music programs and so on. Secondly, it's also necessary to have a rough idea of what the game is going to look like. Then there's the root directory of programs, bug reports and feedback, etc.
2. Scope management
Make a distinction between work and employees in each department, manage everyone's work and follow up on progress.
3. Iteration
Iterations can be both art and program iterations, specifically changes to old code, art mapping, etc. to achieve gameplay refinement based on progress and new requirements.
4. Object-Oriented programming
It may be programming a test for a new mechanism or concept to test whether this will conflict with existing code or whether it is feasible.
5. Model-View-Controller architecture
It's a program that allows you to look at maps, characters, and other models at any time to see if any of them are reporting errors, etc.
## Complete!

You've completed your first homework assignment! Commit this file and push it to GitHub. You should be able to see that it's been submitted properly on the Github Classroom page or on your assignment repository.
